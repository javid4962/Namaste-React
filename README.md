-> `What is Library & Framework - Differences between Library & Framework`

    Libraries and Frameworks are both `Collection of pre-written code` that developers can use to speed up software development.

    1. Libraries `enhance application functionality,` while Frameworks are `used to build & deploy quickly.`
    2. Libraries offer specific functionality without imposing a particular architecture, while Frameworks control the application flow and structure.
